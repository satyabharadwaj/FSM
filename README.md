# DESIGN AND STIMULATION OF LAND ROVER AND FIGO FSM
>The implementation of the Land Rover Figo FSM aims to simulate the behavior of a Land Rover Figo vehicle using a Finite State Machine (FSM). A FSM is a mathematical model that represents a system with a finite number of states and transitions between those states based on certain events or conditions.
